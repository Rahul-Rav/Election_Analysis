# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we are assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee (Tom) in the election audit of the tabulated results for the US congressional precinct in Colorado. We are tasked with reporting: 
1. The total number of votes cast 
2. Total number of votes for each candiddate 
3. Percentage of votes for each candidate
4. Tthe winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Using Python (ver. 3.7.6), we generate a vote count report to certify this US Congressional race.
